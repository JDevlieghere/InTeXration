InTeXration
===========

Due to this project being in a very early development phase, please forgive us the lack of documentation.


Features
--------
InTeXration is a continious integration-like tool for building LaTeX files. It integrates with GitHub using a webhook URL. On each commit the specified .tex-files are compiled to a PDF. You can include the url to this PDF and possibly the log file (which are both fixed) in your README.md to offer interested parties a compiled version of the document(s) in your repository.
